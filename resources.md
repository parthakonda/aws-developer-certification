# Resources to get prepared for the exam

It is required to understand the different quality resources to get started with AWS ceritifcation. I've identified the following resources for both knowledge and mock exams.


# Phase - 1 (Knowledge)
## A Cloud guru
Even though you're a beginner in AWS, you can get started with A Cloud guru videos to gain knowledge. They'll also show you the Lab within the course.

## Plural Sight
Plural sight is also a good resource to get started with AWS. Here is the link https://app.pluralsight.com/paths/certificate/aws-certified-developer-associate

## AWS Faq's
Faq's are one of the important things that needs to be covered. You can find info specific to the topic. https://aws.amazon.com/faqs/

# Phase - 2 (Mock tests)
## Udemy
Udemy got limited number of tests for aws certified developer. Even though these seems to be old but worth to take it.
## A Cloud Guru
A cloud guru in the course itself providing mock tests (quiz).

## Whizlabs

## AWS Mock tests
